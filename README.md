# User Experience (UX)
This website is designed in a mobile first approach, it is designed so the user can navigate throughout the site with lots of call to action buttons.
## User Stories  
* "As a user I would like to navigate easily throughout website"  
* "As a user I would want to check class times"  
* "As a user I want to know about the gyms facilities"  
* "As a user I would like to check membership prices"  
* "As a user I would like to contact the gym"

### Project Goals 
* A fully functional website with a fixed navigation bar so user can easily access each landing page.
* A class timetable with classes/times/days.
* A gallery page where visitors can see the gyms facilities.
* A list of our price range for students and adults.  
* A contact page where users can contact gym and write a short message to us.
